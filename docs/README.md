# Snake
Hello and welcome!
After starting my Git(Hub) adventure, I decided to recreate the game of Snake.
Feel free to join in, create and issue (feat. request, bug report or anything at all)!
If you have any questions on Github or C++ feel free to let me know, I can't promise to have the answer but I will do my best to help!

## Especially for starters:
A special welcome to you! This codebase is very small and doesn't use too many special tricks of C++.
Therefore, most of the things we come across, bugwise or the new features, is good for starting programmers and/or GitHub members.
Feel free to join in!

# About
This version of Snake was created in C++, with just a simple initial idea and then some adjustments.
I wanted to learn both some extra stuff about C++ and try out making a GUI using MSDN.
Additionally, I wanted to experiment with sounds in the game.
